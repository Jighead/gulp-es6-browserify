					<p>These are just examples of what you can do with this scaffold. This works great if you want a modular    setup but dont need a full blown React, or Vue project<br>
						This is the folder structure I like to use for small to medium sized projects but you can modify it to your own needs. Just remember to modify the Gulp file acorddingly.</p>
						<p>You can use classes via ES6 imports and you can create modular components. The nav bar above and the footer below were created as modular components. These components are just classes that use a render function and are appended to an element via jQuery (think React or Vue). They can also contain a constructor, more methods and anything you would normally do in an ES6 class.</p>
